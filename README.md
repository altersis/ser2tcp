# ser2tcp
 This is a Home Asistant Add-on that creates a Soft TCP-to-Serial bridge on your home Assistant server

 Some Home Assistant (HASS) integrations connect with devices that natively use RS-232 serial ports, for example Russound RNET. Those integrations are written assuming that the controlled device (like a Russound CAA) will be connected via a TCP-to-serial adapter. This can be very convenient When the device is located at a different rack or location. In cases where the controlled device is right next to the Home Assistant server, it does not make a lot of sense to use an extra network port and a hardware TCP-to-Serial bridge (for example a Digi or Global Cach√© one). This Add-on repackages TCP2Ser, which is a software TCP to Serial bridge that allows connecting a closely-located device to HASS using an inexpensive USB to RS232 adapter, based on the FTDI/Proliphix chipsets.
